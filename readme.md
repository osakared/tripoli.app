# tripoli.app

This is the informational website for [Tripoli](https://tripoli.app). The web app and API documentation are elsewhere though we may end up integrating the latter into this as well.

## Building

Use `npm start` during dev. Push to the [github mirror](https://github.com/osakared/tripoli.app) manually to build the website. Also keep pushing to the [official home at codeberg](https://codeberg.org/osakared/tripoli.app). Get periodic updates from [original project](https://github.com/adamstddrd/grease).

## Grease
Grease is a website starter for the modern web. Its goal is simple; provide a solid foundation for a fast and adaptable website that's enjoyable to build, and easy to maintain.

It combines a trio of fast, flexible tools ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), and [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)) with a simple, micro-management-free CSS architecture, and lightweight patterns that set you up for success. Highlights:

- **Designed for in-browser design.**
  Fast tools and a straightforward custom-property-powered composable CSS architecture makes designing in browser a joy, and scaffolding new pages *fast*.
- **Expressive color.**
  Grease includes a comprehensive color system that lets you easily support light & dark mode, custom themes, composable themes, and all of the above.
- **Fluid type.**
  A straightforward fluid type system makes it easy to keep your type game on point across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
- **Flexible bundling.**
  Import everything into monolithic CSS and JS bundles? Break out page and section bundles? Inline critical CSS? All supported out of the box, zero configuration.
